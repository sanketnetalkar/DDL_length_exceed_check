# DDL_length_exceed_check
The Python script iterates through the length of each record in every column of the csv file. and checks whether if the record is cross the set ddl limit. As a output the code gives us the index and the records which exceed the ddl limit. By doing this, at a single glance we know which record is crossing the ddl limit instead of checking for all the records manually.
